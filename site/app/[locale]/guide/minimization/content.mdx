## Bloated CSS keyframes
(!) Defining animation keyframes the traditional way.
```css name=main.css
.animation1 {
    animation: animation1 .5s
}

@keyframes animation1 { … }
@keyframes animation2 { … }
/* Hundreds of keyframe rules here... */
```
This method works, but there's a major drawback: even if you only use `animation1`, all other keyframes (e.g., `animation2` and others) will still be included in the final CSS output and runtime styles, resulting in bloated stylesheets.

Master CSS [animations](/guide/configuration#animations) are generated on-demand by parsing the values of `animation` and `animation-name`, then injecting only the necessary keyframes into the final stylesheet.

(o) Customize your keyframes using the Master CSS animations API.
```js name=master.css.js
export default {
    animations: {
        animation1: { … }, /* [!code ++] */
        animation2: { … }, /* [!code ++] */
        …
    }
}
```
To apply the custom `animation1`, use the [animation](/reference/animation) syntax:
```html
<!-- @MARK @animation1|.5s -->
<div class="@animation1|.5s"></div>
```
This will generate only the relevant CSS based on the usage:
```css name=generatedCSS
@keyframes animation1 { … }

.\@animation1\|\.5s {
    animation: animation1 .5s
}
```

## Bloated CSS variables
(!) Defining CSS variables the traditional way.
```css name=main.css
--primary: #000;
--secondary: #fff;
--tertiary: #f00;
... /* Hundreds of CSS variables here... */
```
Although this works, unused variables still end up in the final stylesheet, increasing the CSS payload unnecessarily.

Master CSS [variables](/guide/variables) are generated by analyzing class declarations and injecting only the variables that are actually used.

(o) Customize your CSS variables using the Master CSS variables API.
```js name=master.css.js
export default {
    variables: {
        primary: '#000', /* [!code ++] */
        secondary: '#fff', /* [!code ++] */
        tertiary: '#f00' /* [!code ++] */
    }
}
```
To use a variable like `primary`, simply reference it in a class. Master CSS will automatically generate the corresponding `--primary` declaration:
```html
<!-- @MARK primary -->
<div class="bg:primary"></div><!-- [!code focus] -->
<div class="bg:$color-primary"></div>
```

## Benefits of Reducing CSS Bloat
Minifying and optimizing CSS enhances overall performance and yields measurable improvements:

1. Faster Load Times: Smaller stylesheets mean faster page loads. This significantly improves user experience and contributes to better SEO rankings, as search engines prioritize fast-loading websites.
2. Lower Bandwidth Usage: By shipping only the necessary CSS, less data is transferred over the network—ideal for users on mobile or limited connections.
3. Better Runtime Performance: With fewer styles to parse and render, browsers can process your pages more efficiently. This is especially valuable on low-end devices and legacy browsers.
