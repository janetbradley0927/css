## Overview [sr-only]
<Overview />
The typography system in Master CSS provides a cohesive and scalable approach, [`text:<size>`](/guide/typography#text-scale), to setting text styles. It combines **font size**, **line height**, and **letter spacing** into unified tokens to ensure consistency and visual rhythm across interfaces—from fine print to large headlines.

### Namespaces for typography
The typography system is built on a set of [variables](/guide/variables) that are organized into namespaces. This allows for easy customization and consistent application across your design.

* `font-size` for font sizes, text sizes
* `font-family` for font families
* `font-weight` for font weights
* `line-height` for line height
* `letter-spacing` for letter spacing

## Text scale
At its core, the system is powered by a semantic type scale (`text:3xs` to `text:10xl`) and corresponding font utilities (`font:*`, `line:*`, `tracking:*`) defined through design tokens. These values are carefully calibrated—not just mathematically scaled—to produce an optimal reading experience.

Rather than manually composing multiple properties, you can use `text:<size>` to apply all three attributes—**font-size**, **line-height**, and **letter-spacing**—with a single class, tuned to the specific needs of each text scale.

* `text:3xs ~ text:xs` — For fine print, annotations, captions, or table labels
* `text:sm ~ text:lg` — Standard text sizes for body copy, paragraphs, and buttons
* `text:xl ~ text:3xl` — Ideal for subheadings, lead paragraphs, or callouts
* `text:4xl ~ text:10xl` — Reserved for large headings, page titles, and hero sections

See some classic examples in the following sections. All examples use `text:<size>`, which automatically applies the ideal font size, line height, and letter spacing in a single utility.
<BodyText />
<Headings />
<PageTitles />

### Without vs With `text:<size>`
Manually configuring typography often requires juggling multiple CSS properties like `font-size`, `line-height`, and `letter-spacing`. This can quickly become inconsistent, especially when reused across different components or pages.
<Demo $py={0}>
    <DemoPanel className="flex flex-col gap:8x w:full">
        <div className="w:full">
            <DemoLabel className="fg:crimson">font:5xl</DemoLabel>
            <DemoP className="text:pretty font:5xl font:regular leading:1">Designing for consistency across every platform.</DemoP>
        </div>
        <div className="w:full">
            <DemoLabel className="fg:beryl">text:5xl</DemoLabel>
            <DemoP className="text:pretty text:5xl font:regular">Designing for consistency across every platform.</DemoP>
        </div>
    </DemoPanel>
</Demo>
Let’s compare a manual approach with the simplified `text:<size>` utility:

(!) Manually add the most appropriate style for the title each time
```html
<h1 class="font:3xl tracking:-0.048rem leading:2.4rem">...</h1>
```

You may also find yourself tweaking these values individually for each heading or paragraph, which increases cognitive load and the risk of visual inconsistency.

(o) Using `text:3xl` utility token
```html
<h1 class="text:3xl">...</h1>
```

The `text:lg` token applies a finely tuned combination of:

<Class2CSS>{'text:3xl'}</Class2CSS>

All values are calibrated to provide optimal readability and consistent rhythm across the type scale. No manual calculation, no guesswork—just a reliable, semantic shortcut.

Why this matters? Using `text:<size>` ensures:

* **Consistency** — every instance of `text:lg` looks exactly the same
* **Maintainability** — no need to audit multiple values across stylesheets
* **Scalability** — easier to theme or adjust from a central design token

Whenever possible, prefer `text:<size>` over ad hoc styles. It’s faster, safer, and makes your typography systematically predictable.

## Type scale
The font scale ranges from `font:3xs` to `font:10xl`, with each size intentionally designed to deliver visual harmony and clear hierarchy across a variety of use cases.

## Font families
<FontFamilyBasicUsage />
See the [font family](/reference/font-family) reference for more details on how to add custom fonts.

## Font weights
Our typography system defines a semantic range of font weight tokens, from `font:thin` to `font:heavy`, providing clear naming for visual emphasis and typographic hierarchy.

* `font:thin` extra-light strokes for subtle or elegant UI elements
* `font:light` light weight, ideal for large headings or minimalist design
* `font:regular` default weight for body text and general readability
* `font:medium` slightly bolder for subheadings or emphasis
* `font:bold` strong emphasis, often used in call-to-action or UI labels
* `font:heavy` maximum weight for impact, branding, or visual anchors
