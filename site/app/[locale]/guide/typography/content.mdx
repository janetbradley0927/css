## Overview [sr-only]

### Namespaces for typography
The typography system is built on a set of [variables](/guide/variables) that are organized into namespaces. This allows for easy customization and consistent application across your design.

* `font-size` for font sizes, text sizes
* `font-family` for font families
* `font-weight` for font weights
* `line-height` for line height
* `letter-spacing` for letter spacing

---

## Type scale
The font scale ranges from `font:3xs` to `font:10xl`, with each size intentionally designed to deliver visual harmony and clear hierarchy across a variety of use cases.

* `font:3xs ~ font:xs` Used for fine print, annotations, captions, or table labels
* `font:sm ~ font:lg` Standard text sizes for body copy, paragraphs, and buttons
* `font:xl ~ font:3xl` Ideal for subheadings, lead paragraphs, or callouts
* `font:4xl ~ font:10xl` Reserved for large headings, page titles, and hero sections

## Font families

See the [font family](/reference/font-family) reference for more details on how to add custom fonts.

## Font weights
Our typography system defines a semantic range of font weight tokens, from `font:thin` to `font:heavy`, providing clear naming for visual emphasis and typographic hierarchy.

* `font:thin` extra-light strokes for subtle or elegant UI elements
* `font:light` light weight, ideal for large headings or minimalist design
* `font:regular` default weight for body text and general readability
* `font:medium` slightly bolder for subheadings or emphasis
* `font:bold` strong emphasis, often used in call-to-action or UI labels
* `font:heavy` maximum weight for impact, branding, or visual anchors

## Text scale
However, when setting font size, you typically want to pair it with a corresponding line height. Smaller text sizes use taller line-heights to improve legibility, while larger sizes use tighter spacing to maintain compactness and strong hierarchy.

In our [`text:<size>`](/reference/text-size) system, each size from `text:3xs` to `text:10xl` has a carefully adjusted line-height to achieve balanced readability and visual harmony. These values are not uniform ratios—they're intentionally tuned to suit the visual characteristics of each text scale.
