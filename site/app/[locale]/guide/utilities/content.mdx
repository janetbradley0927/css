## Overview [sr-only]
<Default />
Master CSS enables you to group CSS declarations into reusable classes, streamlining your styling process. Unlike traditional utility classes that simply map to CSS properties, Master CSS introduces a flexible syntax that supports not only declarations, but also integrates seamlessly with [selectors](/guide/selectors) and [at-rules](/guide/at).

This empowers developers to write expressive, maintainable, and highly customizable styles with minimal overhead.
