## Overview [sr-only]
Master CSS supports seamless integration with third-party libraries (like [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com/)) and legacy stylesheets. You can safely load external styles into an isolated `@layer` to avoid unintended style overrides and maintain a clean separation between core, utility, and vendor styles.

(!) You might already be using `!important` with third-party libraries in the following way:
```html
<!-- @MARK bg:blue! -->
<div class="swiper-slide bg:blue!">Slide 1</div>
```
(o) Use this guide to reduce CSS specificity in advance and manage styles in a more organized way:
```html
<!-- @MARK bg:blue -->
<div class="swiper-slide bg:blue">Slide 1</div>
```

## Reducing traditional style specificity
The following examples demonstrate how to import Swiper styles and assign them to the [preset layer](/guide/cascade-layers) for scoped, conflict-free styling.

### Using CSS layering
By importing Swiper styles into the preset layer, you isolate them from your custom styles. This enables safer overrides and preserves predictable cascading behavior across layers.
```css
@import 'swiper/css'; /* [!code --] */
@import 'swiper/css/navigation'; /* [!code --] */
@import 'swiper/css/pagination'; /* [!code --] */

@import 'swiper/css' layer(preset);
@import 'swiper/css/navigation' layer(preset);
@import 'swiper/css/pagination' layer(preset);
```
(!) Note that the `layer(preset)` syntax may only be supported by newer build tools such as Turbopack.

### Using Sass with layered imports
In Sass, `@include meta.load-css()` allows you to import CSS files within a `@layer`, mirroring native CSS layering behavior. This approach is especially useful when integrating external styles into a modular architecture.
```scss
@import 'swiper/css'; /* [!code --] */
@import 'swiper/css/navigation'; /* [!code --] */
@import 'swiper/css/pagination'; /* [!code --] */

@use 'sass:meta';

@layer preset {
    @include meta.load-css('node_modules/swiper/css');
    @include meta.load-css('node_modules/swiper/css/navigation');
    @include meta.load-css('node_modules/swiper/css/pagination');
}
```

## Uniformly overrides traditional styles
Using the preset layer to reduce the specificity of traditional styles allows you to override them directly through custom [components](/guide/components), without the risk of your styles being unintentionally overridden.

For example, create custom components for Swiper.
```js name=master.css.js
export default {
    components: {
        swiper: {
            '': 'max-w:screen-sm',  // .swiper
            wrapper: 'bg:red',      // .swiper-wrapper
            slide: 'bg:blue'        // .swiper-slide
        }
    }
}
```
This way, you can override the default styles without worrying about specificity conflicts.

## Summary
In advance, you can reduce CSS specificity by using the preset layer to reduce style specificity in a more organized way. This allows you to avoid using `!important` and maintain a clean separation between core, utility, and vendor styles.

- **Avoid style collisions:** Vendor styles often come with opinionated defaults. Assigning them to a separate layer keeps your design system in control.
- **Maintainable overrides:** Targeting a specific layer lets you override styles more deliberately and cleanly.
- **Improved compatibility:** Layered architecture promotes progressive enhancement and makes integrating with utility-first or component-based CSS frameworks more reliable.
