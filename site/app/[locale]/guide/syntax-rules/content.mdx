## Overview [sr-only]
<Default />

In Master CSS, most syntax rules are defined and implemented through the `config.rules`. You can create your own custom syntax rules and use them directly within the `class=""` attribute.

These custom rules are fully compatible with Master CSS’s advanced features, including selectors, at-rules, functions, and variables—offering a powerful and flexible styling experience.

Use this as a last resort when implementing your design system or styling conventions. Avoid creating custom syntax rules unless absolutely necessary, as overuse can lead to reduced maintainability and consistency across your codebase.
