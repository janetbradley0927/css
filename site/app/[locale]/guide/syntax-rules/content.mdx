## Overview [sr-only]
<Default />

In Master CSS, most syntax rules are defined and implemented through the `config.rules`. You can create your own custom syntax rules and use them directly within the `class=""` attribute.

These custom rules are fully compatible with Master CSS’s advanced features, including selectors, at-rules, functions, and variables—offering a powerful and flexible styling experience.

Use this as a last resort when implementing your design system or styling conventions. Avoid creating custom syntax rules unless absolutely necessary, as overuse can lead to reduced maintainability and consistency across your codebase.

## Add a custom syntax rule
Create your own syntax rule.
<Overview />
Master CSS does not provide methods like `declare` or `transform` to let you fully customize the syntax, but instead exposes limited `transformers` and `declarers` to let you extend practical syntax rules. You should rely on the implicit behavior built into Master CSS to achieve the desired effect, but more often than not you will need `config.components`.

## Syntax rule types
Master CSS uses `SyntaxRuleType` to determine the priority of CSS rule generation. By default, each rule is intentionally ordered to minimize style conflicts and reduce the need for overrides.
