As Vite continues to grow rapidly and become the mainstream tool for development, developers are increasingly turning to Vite to build their applications. Initially, we created a Vite plugin solely to integrate the Master CSS static extraction mode, with other modes requiring manual setup. Now, with the `@master/css.vite` plugin, all rendering modes of Master CSS can be integrated with zero configuration.

## All-in-one Vite plugin
We've simplified the setup process, reducing the number of steps and removing the need for guides on different rendering modes, as the setup has become easier.

If you don't have a project yet, create one using `npm create vite@latest my-app`.
```bash action=install
@master/css.vite@rc
```
Once installed, simply add the plugin to `vite.config.js` to enable any mode:
```js name=vite.config.js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import masterCSS from '@master/css.vite' // [!code highlight]

export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
        masterCSS() // [!code highlight]
    ]
})
```
By default, the `options.mode` is set to the classic `runtime` mode, and you can choose other [available modes](/guide/rendering-modes#available-modes) as needed.

Now run your vite development server and start using Master CSS!
```bash action=run
run dev
```

## Other integrations
Thanks to Vite's thriving ecosystem, we’ve also established framework integrations for [Nuxt](/guide/installation/nuxtjs)
```ts name=nuxt.config.ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
    modules: [
        '@master/css.nuxt' // 'progressive' [!code highlight]
        // ['@master/css.nuxt', { mode: 'extract' }]
        // ['@master/css.nuxt', { mode: 'runtime' }]
        // ['@master/css.nuxt', { mode: 'pre-render' }]
    ]
})
```
and [Astro](/guide/installation/astro).
```ts name=astro.config.ts
import masterCSS from '@master/css.astro'

export default defineConfig({
    integrations: [
        masterCSS() // 'runtime' [!code highlight]
        // masterCSS({ mode: 'extract' })
    ]
})
```

That's it! You can now use Master CSS in your any project with ease. For full information, check out the [installation guide](/guide/installation).
